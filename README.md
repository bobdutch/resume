My Résumé
=========

This is a [nanoc][] project for my résumé. I feel that a 
Rails project with MySQL is massively inefficient, but 
my old HTML/CSS version was just as bad.

Feel free to fork this if you want to build your own, but 
I'd wait a bit. It's still missing a bunch of features 
that I'd like to support, and the data structure 
isn't quite ready. 

I'm still in the middle of converting my old markup to 
the [hresume microformat][hresume].

So if, despite the forewarning, read on to learn how to... 

Build Your Own
--------------

You'll need to install Haml, Compass, JSMin, and nanoc gems.
